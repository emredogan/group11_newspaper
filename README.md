Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Security Disclaimer 

We are aware that hiding our API keys, by for example adding them to our .gitignore file and therefor hiding them from the public, is the only option that grants security. Nevertheless, we have decided to add the .env file to the root of our project to enable you an easier way to set up our application. This is a decision we would not make in a real company environment.
